   <h3>Life Event,Marriage</h3>
   <dl>
      <dd>Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock,
         is a culturally and often legally recognised union between people called spouses.
         It establishes rights and obligations between them, as well as between them and their children (if any),<br>
          and between them and their in-laws.[1] It is nearly a cultural universal,
          [2] but the definition of marriage varies between cultures and religions, and over time.
           Marriage becomes a social construct to adjudicate the conflicts of interest between consenting individuals[3][unreliable source?] and a transactional means to fulfill their needs.<br>
           [4][unreliable source?] Typically, it is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged or sanctioned.<br>
            In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing sexual activity. A marriage ceremony is called a wedding, while a private marriage is sometimes called an elopement.</dd>
